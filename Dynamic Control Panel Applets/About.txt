You can add your own applets to the control panel easily.  Provided is a prototype .cpl file which will read an .ini file and produce applets in the control panel. The .cpl file and .ini file should both be placed in the system directory.  All you have to do is edit the .ini file manually or write a ui program like the included one which edits the .ini.  Also provided is the source for the .cpl file. (which I rewrote in C which works easier in Dev-C++, from a terrific c++ article by Roberto Ianni, look for it on line.)  The VB program uses a rewrite of the ucComboDir5Lite by Thierry Calu (http://www.Planet-Source-Code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=65313&lngWId=1)
